MEMORYSTORY
MEMORY ???
SONIC : REMINISCENCE
------------------------------------------
> Sonic mode
	
	- Control an Emerl through Sonic-like stages. A zone is one center and 4 areas around. 
		1 BGM for center, 1 for suburbs. Center has less monster (if any) and more shops or so.
		Different tileset for center and suburbs. Different parallaxes in each suburb, maybe the second half overlapping with next zone.

		Any area has some path to go from north <-> south to east <-> west. This change level structure, parallax and destination.
		Area travel must be beautiful through eye candy.

	- Enemy silouette (or visible) appears in some places of the area. Contact with it :
		- If area level is too high, the silhouette jumps to catch you on higher radius and trigger fight. Also trigger enemy preemptive strike.
		- If area level around your level, only trigger on direct contact. Might trigger enemy preemptive stike randomly.
		- If area level below your level, won't trigger unless explicit by pressing UP or smthing
		- Press attack button right before contact to do a preemptive strike. 

	- Early Emerl has low run speed, low jump height, but maps are easy. He gets upgrades in some places of the game. Upgrades include
		> Run Speed : from 1 to 5 levels, or so
		> Jump height : from 1 to 3 or so
		> Air tricks : choose [1,2] among a few (Sonic Advance)
		> Attack : allows to preemptive strike, from 1 to 3 level or so. Also destroys certain obstacle
		> Air action : gliding, thok attack, etc.
		> Special moves : double tap to dash, peel out, sudden stop, etc.		
		- Some later stages might require certain upgrades to pass.
	
	- Stages have rings that you get to keep upon leaving area
		Getting hit by hazard drops a certain amount depending on the hazard and are lost. Damages your RPG units directly if you 
		don't have enough rings to tank (damage that ignores RPG defense, does in % ?) If RPG units all die, go to last save (wipeout).
		Pits might do a lot of damage, not sure.
		Later stages have more rings but also more hazards.
		Cross an area with decent time to get bonus rings maybe. Rings have a respawn timer that triggers on area leave.

	- Contain [RING] resource, the main money of the game
	- Contain certain [RESOURCE] obtainable specific to some areas

> RPG mode
	
	- Start a fight in an area with up to 4 units in late game. 
	- RPG stats include strength/mind, speed, initiative, prospection etc
	- RPG fights give [EXPERIENCE] resource. Amount is most effective when the unit is close to enemy level (like Dofus)
		- Experience increases level, which increases basic stats.
		- Also might "evolve" or something at some point, giving new abilities or passives to the unit
	- RPG fights also drop [RESOURCE] to create equipment or tools.
------------------------------------------------------
RESOURCE and RING allow to buy or create stuff.
> Certain Emerl enhancements
> Certain equipments for units
> Unlock (alternatives), areas, or difficulties (like version SP / X or enemies similar to units)
> Certain units...?
